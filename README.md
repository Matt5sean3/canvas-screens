# canvas-screens
Provides a system for managing movement between screens in a relatively simple manner.

## What is a screen?
In this case a screen is similar to the concept of a state. Think of a splash screen during a computer's start, a pause screen during a game, or a configuration screen.

For purposes of this project a screen includes the functionality for displaying what needs to be drawn on the canvas, adding and removing event handlers as appropriate, and playing any media appropriate to the state. Mostly, this is focused upon manipulation of the canvas and rendering context in this project.
